# NasCanAI (Nasopharyngeal Cancer Prediction Machine Learning Project)

## Overview

This machine learning project is designed to predict nasopharyngeal cancer based on relevant features extracted from breast cancer data. The model is trained on a dataset with various characteristics and labels indicating progression-free or overall survival.

## Project Structure

- ***`R`***: R source code/scripts for the data reprocessing and building machine learning model.
- ***`input`***: input datasets
- ***```output```***: output results

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gkarakatsoulis/BrCanAI.git
