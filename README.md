# BrCanAI (Breast Cancer Prediction Machine Learning Project)

## Overview

This machine learning project is designed to predict breast cancer based on relevant features extracted from breast cancer data. The model is trained on a dataset with various characteristics and labels indicating the presence or absence of breast cancer.

## Project Structure

- **`R`**: R source code/scripts for the datapreprocessing and building machine learning model.
- **`models`**: Saved machine learning models ??

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gkarakatsoulis/BrCanAI.git
